      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>
        This project was created as a documentary animation focused on one of the most tragic
        periods in history — the Siege of Leningrad.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="case-block">
      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>
        The goal was not to recreate historical events literally, but to communicate the emotional
        atmosphere, human experience and sense of time through motion, pacing and visual restraint.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="case-block">
      <h2>Concept & Approach</h2>
      <p>
        I approached the project with a minimal and restrained visual style, avoiding decorative
        animation in favor of clarity, pauses and rhythm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Motion was used as a narrative tool — not to entertain, but to support the story and
        emotional tension.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="case-block">
      <h2>Motion Design Focus</h2>
      <p>
        Special attention was paid to timing, silence and transitions between scenes.
        Slower pacing and controlled motion were intentionally used to reflect the weight
        of the subject and allow the viewer to absorb the content.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="case-block">
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>
        The process included research, storyboard development and multiple motion tests
        to find the right balance between expressiveness and restraint.
      </p>
      <p>
        All animation was created in After Effects, with a focus on clean transitions
        and a consistent visual language.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="case-block">
      <h2>Result & Recognition</h2>
      <p>
        The final animation delivers a clear and emotionally grounded narrative within a short
        time frame.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project was awarded first place in the Animir All-Russian animation competition
        in the Documentary Animation category.
